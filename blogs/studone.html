							How it started
						</h2>
						<p>
							This app idea wasn't mine. A few months ago, I met a
							stranger from the other side of the globe on a
							Discord server. He had this vision of an app that
							helps students learn more efficiently and organize
							their time so that they can spend less time
							learning. I thought that it was a cool idea, so I
							joined to create an MVP and test it out. The purpose
							of this app is to give the user multiple attested
							learning techniques and group them under one
							umbrella while keeping it simple. There are many
							productivity apps of this type; the most famous one
							is Notion. While Notion offers tools to use the same
							learning techniques as Studone, it's much harder to
							set up. Studone has all of these features right out
							of the box. So with the motivation to help students
							and create useful software, our journey started with
							designing and developing the MVP.

							Main Features
						</h2>
						<p>
							The MVP has four main learning methods: learning
							using flashcards based on active recall, quiz-type
							learning where you get a multiple-choice answer,
							filling out missing parts of mindmaps, and writing
							summaries and then filling out missing words from
							summaries. The MVP provides a text editor to write
							notes with text highlight capabilities.
							<br /><br />
							All these methods are organized by topics and
							subjects. Each topic has a name, a number of days
							between exercises, and an expiration date. This
							topic refers to a set of data containing the methods
							mentioned above as well as editors for each method.
							All the topics are shown as an overview in the
							dashboard calendar, so whenever a user logs in, he
							or she sees immediately what the topics for today
							are, as well as an overview of the current month.

							App Structure
						</h2>
						<div class="d-flex align-items-center">
							<i
								class="bi bi-terminal main-article__icon me-3"
							></i>
							<h5 class="mb-0">Backend</h5>
						</div>
						<p>
							The backend is made with
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								href="https://nextjs.org/"
								>Next</a
							>
							and served by
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								href="https://nginx.org/en/"
								>Ngnix</a
							>
							in a Linux environment. Using Next comes with an
							out-of-the-box setup, which makes API development
							effortless. The API has three base routes: /auth for
							authentication, /data/[dataype] for CRUD operations
							with the app data, and /payments for payments.
						</p>
						<div class="d-flex align-items-center">
							<i
								class="bi bi-fingerprint main-article__icon me-3"
							></i>
							<h5 class="mb-0">Authentication</h5>
						</div>
						<p class="mb-3">
							Next comes with
							<a
								href="https://next-auth.js.org/"
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								>Next-Auth</a
							>, which is by far the easiest type of user
							authentication I have ever implemented in a web app.
							It is easy to understand and fast. But it comes with
							its downsides; for example, the sign-in function
							runs on every page request, and because Next uses a
							per-page router, it makes the app navigation slower
							than it should. This problem caused me to revert
							back to a React router to avoid checking the payment
							status between app screens, which makes the whole
							Next router kind of useless.
						</p>
						<div class="d-flex align-items-center">
							<i class="bi bi-paypal main-article__icon me-3"></i>
							<h5 class="mb-0">Payments</h5>
						</div>
						<p class="mb-3">
							In this app, I have Implemented a subscription
							solution with PayPal. It was the first time I
							implemented real payment into a website, and the
							integration process took me a while to understand.
							In part because of the way information is organized
							in the PayPal documentation and because of my lack
							of experience. But in the end, I figured it out,
							which gives me more confidence in my abilities.
						</p>
						<div class="d-flex align-items-center">
							<i
								class="bi bi-aspect-ratio main-article__icon me-3"
							></i>
							<h5 class="mb-0">Landing page</h5>
						</div>
						<p class="mb-3">
							Since this version of the app is only an MVP, we
							didn't want to invest any money, so I came up with
							the design for the landing page. I definitely
							wouldn't consider myself even close to a designer,
							but I still made this design with the design
							principles I already knew (e.g., spacing, hierarchy,
							contrast). And I can't complain too much about the
							outcome; it fits the style we went for, but it could
							be improved without a doubt. After the hard part was
							done, putting it into code was a piece of cake with
							the Next and Tailwind combination. Also because
							Tailwind is the fastest way to write CSS, in my
							opinion.
						</p>
						<div class="d-flex align-items-center">
							<i
								class="bi bi-display main-article__icon me-3"
							></i>
							<h5 class="mb-0">Client</h5>
						</div>
						<p>
							By far the most challenging part of the project. The
							client incorporates many third-party libraries for
							the various UI tasks that it needs to accomplish.
							And while saving time on those tasks, the libraries
							still require a lot of polishing to become part of
							the app in a way that doesn't feel strange. The
							component library used is
							<a
								href="https://flowbite.com/"
								target="_blank"
								data-hover="true"
								>Flowbite</a
							>, which is a Tailwind-based UI library with
							minimalistic components.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<h2 id="conclusion" class="main-article__subtitle">
							Conclusion
						</h2>
						<p>
							The app in its current state is not market-ready. It
							requires a lot of polishing and many more features,
							which we plan to add in the long run. With that
							said, I have learned a ton of things working on this
							web application. I learned about time management,
							the importance of modularization, collaboration with
							other programmers, and how vital unit tests are. I'm
							glad about this experience and would love to see
							this product out there providing value to students.
