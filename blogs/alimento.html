							How it started
						</h2>
						<p>
							After going through a period in my life of unhealthy
							eating, I was gaining a lot of weight and had the
							lowest energy and motivation in my life. I needed a
							change, and in the past year I've gotten really
							interested in nutrition, and I have done my best to
							live a healthy lifestyle. Around that time, I also
							resumed going to the gym after 2-3 years of rest.
							This new lifestyle brought me into the kitchen, but
							eating healthy came with a price to pay. Besides the
							financial cost of healthy food, there was time and
							effort to put in.
							<br /><br />
							While in the kitchen, I started to learn about
							macronutrients, minerals, and vitamins, which added
							complexity to the process of cooking and shopping
							for groceries. To reduce the time spent in the
							kitchen, I started to write down some meal
							combinations for one day. This allowed me to spend
							less time at the grocery store and have more time
							for myself.
							<br /><br />
							When Chat GPT was first released, I started
							experimenting with it. I saw that it could create
							instruction lists for various things, and one day I
							had an idea to speed up my meal preparation process.
							So I made this app that uses the GPT-3 API to
							generate meal plans based on the needs of the user.
							Then save those meal plans and keep track of the
							macronutrients and kilocalories.

							<h5 class="mb-0">Backend</h5>

						<p>
							The backend is made with
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"

								>Node</a
							>
							and
							<a
								data-hover="true"

							and served by
							<a
								data-hover="true"

								href="https://nginx.org/en/"
								>Ngnix</a
							>
							in a Linux environment. It serves the landing page
							but also has an API for the client. Although
							unsophisticated, the API does it's job. It has three
							base routes: /auth, /mealplan, and /user; and a
							middleware for authentication.
						</p>
						<ul class="list-unstyled mb-3">
							<li>
								<b>/auth</b> handles the various authentication
								strategies and the logout of users.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>/user</b> returns the username and tokens if
								the client is logged in with a valid session.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>/mealplan</b> communicates with the GPT-3 API
								to give it a prompt based on the user inputs in
								the client, and saves the returned data in the
								database if the request is successful. It also
								returns data in different formats based on the
								client's needs.

							<h5 class="mb-0">Authentication</h5>
						</div>
						<p class="mb-3">
							In this project, I have implemented an
							authentication strategy with
							<a
								href="https://www.passportjs.org/"
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								>Passport</a
							>, a library for
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								href="https://expressjs.com/"
								target="_blank"
								>Express</a
							>. Even though I have implemented strategies with
							JWT in the past, I wanted to provide users of
							Alimento with the option to log in with Google, and
							Passport came in very handy. I loved the
							implementation process. It is flexible, easy to
							follow, easy to understand, and customizable in
							every step of the way; it requires a little setup
							but saves a lot of time with the prebuilt
							strategies. The overall development experience
							allowed me to learn more about Express and
							middleware.

							<h5 class="mb-0">Landing page</h5>
						</div>
						<p class="mb-3">
							The objective of the landing page was to present the
							app and encourage people to sign up for it. For this
							purpose, I bought a theme from
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								href="https://themeforest.net/"
								>Themeforest</a
							>
							called
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								href="https://themeforest.net/item/appilo-app-landing-page/22227898"
								>Apillo</a
							>, which I slightly changed to fit the needs of the
							app. The theme was built on
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								href="https://getbootstrap.com/"
								>Bootstrap 5</a
							>, and even though I was not familiar with this CSS
							toolkit, it was pretty intuitive since I have spent
							some time building with
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
								>Tailwind</a
							>. It was a nice experience, and I'm happy with the
							end result.

							app, following the design of the landing page. The
							client was the biggest part of this project. The
							challenge was to develop a simple but engaging UI.
							The Idea was to have three Different tabs: one for
							the user data, one for the generated meal plans, and
							one for an overview of the eating lifestyle. But
							there are many more moving parts. I've implemented a
							basic search engine that runs on the client to keep
							the server free, some data filters, and error
							handling. The biggest challenge was implementing the
							statistics view. I had to find some workarounds
							because of the nature of the GPT-3 text generation,
							it's impossible to parse that text to get the
							required data without another AI, so I had to make
							some strange calculations on the backend, which may
							not be a 100% accurate representation but is an
							acceptable solution in this case.

							Conclusion
						</h2>
						<p>
							From design to deployment, all I can say is that I
							enjoyed every part of this process. Knowing that it
							can be improved, I'm happy with how it turned out in
							the end. The purpose was to make a system for
							generating and tracking meal plans, and it does that
							job pretty well. One thing that I will do
							differently on the next project is start with a
							<a
								data-hover="true"
								target="_blank"
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
								>TTD</a
							>
							approach. In this case, the code is understandable
							without tests, but if I were to add more
							functionalities, it would immediately become legacy
							code and therefore harder to change and update
							without wasting a lot of time in the process. For
							now, I don't plan to expand on this project any
							further.
